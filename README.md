# Logs Processor - recruitment coding task

## Requirements for this coding assignment:
- Java 8
- Use of any open-source library is allowed
- Your program must use a gradle build system to resolve dependencies, build and test

## Summary of task
Our custom-build server logs different events to a file. Every event has 2 entries in a log - one entry when the event was started and another when
the event was finished. The entries in a log file have no specific order (it can occur that a specific event is logged before the event starts)

Every line in the file is a JSON object containing event data:
- id - the unique event identifier
- state - whether the event was started or finished (can have values "STARTED" or "FINISHED"
- timestamp - the timestamp of the event in milliseconds

Application Server logs also have the additional attributes:
- type - type of log
- host - hostname

Example:

{"id":"scsmbstgra", "state":"STARTED", "type":"APPLICATION_LOG", "host":"12345", "timestamp":1491377495212}  
{"id":"scsmbstgrb", "state":"STARTED", "timestamp":1491377495213}  
{"id":"scsmbstgrc", "state":"FINISHED", "timestamp":1491377495218}  
{"id":"scsmbstgra", "state":"FINISHED", "type":"APPLICATION_LOG", "host":"12345", "timestamp":1491377495217}  
{"id":"scsmbstgrc", "state":"STARTED", "timestamp":1491377495210}  
{"id":"scsmbstgrb", "state":"FINISHED", "timestamp":1491377495216}  
...

In the example above, the event scsmbstgrb duration is 1401377495216 - 1491377495213 = 3ms

The longest event is scsmbstgrc (1491377495218 - 1491377495210 = 8ms)

The program should:
- Take the input file path as input argument
- Flag any long events that take longer than 4ms with a column in the database called "alert"
- Write the found event details to file-based HSQLDB ( http://hsqldb.org/) in the working folder
  - The application should a new table if necessary and enter the following values:
    - Event id
    - Event duration
    - Type and Host if applicable
    - "alert" true is applicable

Additional points will be granted for:
- Proper use of info and debug logging
- Proper use of Object Oriented programming
- Unit test coverage
- Multi-threaded solution
- Program that can handle very large files (gigabytes)

## My comment

I had to code it in short time so below I put what could be done in the future.

## TODO
- Better tests coverage
- Tests with big files
- Storing databases in different places for production and test usage
- Support for errors in log file. For example:
  - more than 2 events with the same ID (additional table)
  - only 1 event with the same ID
- Support for checking STARTED/FINISHED states
- Adding cache for better performance
